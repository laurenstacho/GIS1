This folder contains the lecture slides I use for my course when I teach in person lectures. There is usually enough text and information on each slide to not need any accompanying lecture materials. However, each set of slides also has a YouTube video of the same name that covers the materials as well. The YouTube videos also demonstrate the various skills and tools students in my class learn each week while working on lab activities. 

A separate file in this folder titled "YouTube Lecture Links" has the list of YouTube videos that are the companions to each set of lecture slides.
