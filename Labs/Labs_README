#FOR TEACHERS
The labs are written to focus on the data type, not the specific dataset, so you can modify any of the lab documents and datasets to fit your course. For example, I teach in eastern Washington, therefore many lab examples use scenarios applicable to that area. You can easily modify a lab to subset different pieces that suit your needs. All labs are written using freely available data that can be accessed via online caches or the ESRI Living Atlas data respository. Any other data that I made specifically for the course is provided in the appropriate folder for that lab. 

#FOR STUDENTS
Each lab comes with a lab document with a basic scenario and set of data you will use to complete the lab. Each lab has its own folder and all the materials you need to complete the lab are located in that folder or you are given explicit instructions on where to find the data online. If you are working along with the pace of the course I teach, then aim to complete one lab a week to match the pace of the lecture slides. If you are using this course to learn GIS on your own at your own pace, then feel free to speed up or slow down as fits your needs, just be sure you are matching the lectures with the labs so you do not get confused.
