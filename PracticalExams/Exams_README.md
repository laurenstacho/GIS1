# Practice Practical Exams

For students who take this class with me at Eastern Washington University, there is a midterm and final practical exam. These exams consist of 10 skills or tools they must complete in a single lab session for full mark potential. 

I give students practice exams to work on each week in preparation for the real exams in Week 5 and Week 10 of the term. If students in my class complete all the midterm practice exams, they do not need to complete Lab 5 (which is a literature review essay). The same is true for the practice final exams and Lab 10 for the term. 

Each practice exam comes with a dataset and series of tasks to complete. If you are a teacher using these materials, these practice exams make for good question banks for your own exams. If you are a student, these are great study aids and if you can complete them with ease then you have grasped the main learning objectives for the lab. Each exam is designed to take at most 60 minutes (less prepared individuals may take longer).
