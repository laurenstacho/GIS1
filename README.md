# GIS1
This repository contains materials for an introductory level GIS course prep for teachers and students. The course materials include weekly lectures that match to weekly lab activities. Each folder within the course has a README for both teachers and students to help guide you in using these materials. I teach this course at Eastern Washington University over a period of 10 weeks, so that is the baseline pace I refer to throughout the course. 

If you are a teacher using these materials to build your own course prep, I do not recommend a faster pace than two short labs per week for introductory students. I have found that the learning curve to understanding the program is steep enough without the added weight of learning what GIS is and the various aspects of geoprocessing workflows.

If you are a student using these materials to learn GIS on your own, "Welcome!" I am so glad you're here! GIS is an amazing science and set of tools that can be applied to a wide breadth of disciplines and fields. You can treat this like a Kaggle course and blaze through the lectures and labs quickly, but if you are brand new to GIS then I suggest you spend a bit of extra time at the beginning really getting to know the ArcGIS Pro software. There are many open source GIS programs out there today, but this course focuses mainly on the most commonly used proprietary software from ESRI know as ArcGIS Pro.
